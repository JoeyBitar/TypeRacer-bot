# TypeRacer-bot
This script is designed to type at any given speed. Since TypeRacer.com randomizes it's HTML element, using serenum or beautifulsoup is not possible. This script will in fact take a screenshot of the TypeRacer text and then convert it into string letters, which it will then type and allow one to get < 300 words per minute.

# Functionality
Upon launching the application, you will then need to select (x,y) coordinates of the text in which you would like to type. You can do this by hovering your mouse at the top left corner of the text and pressing L.CTRL.

To complete the screenshot, you will then need to hover your mouse at the end(Bottom right) of the TypeRacer text and then press on L.ALT. This will then create a screenshot which will convert the text embed in the png image into string letters.

Here is a picture to illustrate the screenshot process:

After the screenshot image has been creating(in the current directory). Press Space bar to execute the typing script.
