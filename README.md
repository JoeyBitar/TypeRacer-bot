# TypeRacer-bot
This script is designed to type at any given speed. Since TypeRacer.com randomizes it's HTML element, using serenum or beautifulsoup is not possible. This script will in fact take a screenshot of the TypeRacer text and then convert it into string letters, which it will then type and allow one to get < 300 words per minute.
